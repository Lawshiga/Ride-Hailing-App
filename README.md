# Ride-Hailing-App
This is a ride hailing android app for three wheelers

Three wheeler drivers find it hard to get the passengers(customers) who are in need of a ride at a particular time. Because drivers may not know the exact location of the customers.And the another thing is if the passenger is already a customer then the customer can call the three-wheeler over cellphone. But it is obviously not a reliable and effective way. Sometimes drivers may misunderstand the location details conveyed by the customer over the phone call. So, it could end up in bad customer satisfaction. These lead to a great drawback in the business perspective. Hence, an automated system would be more useful inorder to get rid of these obstacles. So, this inspires us to build an app that could handle the above mentioned scenarios more intelligently.

The app includes the following features:
  Locate the driver and customer,
  Estimate the distance of the journey,
  Estimate the fare,
  Notify when driver is about to arrive,
  Rate the service of driver.
  
 The prerequisites:
  Android Studio 3.1.0 |
  Android SDK tools 26.1.1 |
  Java JDK 1.8.0_92 |
